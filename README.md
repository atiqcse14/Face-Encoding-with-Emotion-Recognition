# Face-Encoding-with-Emotion-Recognition
The main purpose of this mechanism is to match whether two faces are of the same person or not. This mechanism requires some steps which include finding faces in an image. After that, it examines the facial features of the two detected faces and then compares them whether they match or not. The output shows the result in either True or False. This project also predict the emotion of any person.

Here, we have attached our code (.ipynb version) along with our own Face model (face_m). Whole work was completed in Kaggle Notebooks.
